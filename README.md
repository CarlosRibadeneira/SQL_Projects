# SQL_Projects

Words such as entities, attributes, relationships keys, normalization, select, from, where, group by, having, joins and many more have a completely new meaning to me and opened my mind to the data world. I am adding a compilation of projects that show my growth in this amazing field.

Project 1 paved the way to understanding the fundaments of relational databases and start developing queries. In this project, I created a relational schema and dependency diagram.  More importantly, I comprehended the benefits of normalization. https://1drv.ms/w/s!AqWIgPdfPBHxm138_A9-OKKqbrCX?e=lqytjn

Project 2 shows data exploration as well as a combination of queries whose objective is to answer common questions. I used a database provided by Database Systems, Carlos Coronel and Steven Morris, in order to test my skills.

In Project 3, I tested my skills by carrying out more challenging problems. The database used was a Pet Shop company.

In Project 4, I developed knowledge about creating and altering tables. I made sure to include specific criteria when altering the tables. This database comes from a Construction company.
