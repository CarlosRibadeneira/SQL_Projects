# SQL_Projects

Understanding SQL and the theory behind data bases was the beginning of my new passion. It was complex, torturous at times but fascinating nonetheless.  I was exposed to many different projects that help me understand the fundaments of relational data bases while meanwhile learning the syntax of SQL. Words such as entities, attributes, relationships keys, normalization, select, from, where, group by, having, joins and many more gained a completely different meaning to me and opened my mind to the data world. I am adding a compilation of projects that show my growth in this amazing field. 


My first project paved the way to understand the fundaments of relational data bases and start developing queries. In this project I created a relational schema and dependency diagram and more importantly grasp normalization. 

Project 2 shows data exploration as well as a combination of queries whose objective is to answer common questions. I used a database provided by the Book in order to test my skills. 

In Project 3 I tested my skills carrying out more challenging problems. The database used was for a Pet Shop company.

In Project 4 I develop knowledge about creating and altering tables. I made sure to include specific criteria when altering the tables. This database comes from a construction company.
